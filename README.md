### Pre-requisites

The Python version used to write the code is `3.9.0`. A virtualenv was created and all packages used are in `requirements.txt`.

Once your virtualenv is set up, you can install all packages using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You could also do the below to run the Django server locally:

```
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py runserver
```
